## Round Player for Android
============================

The 360 video player for Androd gives a full 360 degree view of the various angles covered by video. We have given functionality of getting videos from local storage as well as from the internet. We have added an API to download videos from youtube and usse them in 360 degrees video player.

The above app was built in a Hackathon held by Viacom18 at Bits Pilani in 2017.
